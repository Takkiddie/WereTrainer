There is a knock on your door and you get up to answer.

You open the door and almost fall in backward. On your porch stands an enormous werewolf.

Standing there, frozen, you have just long enough to wonder if he's going to kill you.

Werewolf:

"I need you to train me." he says.

None:

Slightly less alarmed, but no less surprised, you manage a response.

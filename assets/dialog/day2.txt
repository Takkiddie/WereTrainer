None:

You hear another knock on the door. You hide Garou in a back room to avoid scaring your guest, and go to answer the door. For the second time in a very short time, you're stunned to see who your visitor is.

Mr. Stacks:

Mr. Fowl, a pleasure to meet you. Do you mind if I come in, I have a bit of important business that I don't wish to conduct on a porch.

Nervous You:

Umm... I would but my house is a bit of a mess right now.

Mr. Stacks:

I see... well fine I suppose I can make this short. I understand that you are the best in the business at training weres and I have an offer for you. It may seem like a dangerous one but...

Emoting Mr. Stacks:

Garou!

None:

You turn around to see your werewolf peering out at the two of you from a window.

Nervous You:

Mr. Stacks, I can explain, he's...

You: 

Wait, you know his name?

Emoting Mr. Stacks:

Garou, what are you doing here? I told you I'd make him the offer and then-

Garou:

He said yes.

Mr. Stacks:

Oh. Ah... I suppose I picked the right man for the job after all. 

You:

What's going on?

None:

Stacks pulls out a contract and hands it to you.

Mr. Stacks:

I wanted to hire you as Garou's personal trainer, I need him to win a few were-dog tournaments before the end of the year. I'll take care of everything financially. Expenses, supplies, equipment, everything you need. As well as a sizable commission.

Also, my lawyers will handle all the paper work. Sign this and you won't ever have to worry...

You:

Done!

None:

You hand back the signed paper to the surprised Mr. Stacks.

Mr. Stacks:

I suppose I'll leave you to it then.

None:

You hear another knock on the door. You hide Garou in a back room to avoid scaring your guest, and go to answer the door. Even expecting him, you are shocked to see who is at your door.

Mr. Stacks:

Mr. Fowl, a pleasure to meet you. Do you mind if I come in, I have a bit of important business that I don't wish to conduct on a porch.

Nervous You:

(I guess Garou was telling the truth.)

Is it about your werewolf?

Mr. Stacks:

Yes. I understand that you are the best in the business at training weres and I have an offer for you. It may seem like a dangerous one but...

Emoting Mr. Stacks:

Wait. How did you know that I... Garou! Get out here, I know your in there!

None:

Your werewolf sheepishly steps out of hiding. 

Garou: 

He said yes.

Emoting Mr. Stacks:

That's... 

Mr. Stacks:

...

Well... I suppose I picked the right man for the job after all. 

You:

So, what exactly is going on here?

None:

Stacks pulls out a contract and hands it to you.

Mr. Stacks:

I wanted to hire you as Garou's personal trainer, I need him to win a few were-dog tournaments before the end of the year. I'll take care of everything financially. Expenses, supplies, equipment, everything you need. As well as a sizable commission.

Also, my lawyers will handle all the paper work. Sign this and you won't ever have to worry...

You:

Done!

None:

You hand back the signed paper to the surprised Mr. Stacks.

Mr. Stacks:

I suppose I'll leave you to it then.
